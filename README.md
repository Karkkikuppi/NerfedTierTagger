# Tier Tagger
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a forked version of Tier Tagger made for the purpose of neutering the tabcompletion provided by the /tiertagger command, which shows the names of player entities nearby on servers, where this functionality may be prohibited. Yes, fully aware that this is just what skin layers do. The main Tier Tagger project has a completely reasonable implementation with what they're working with. This fork was created as a proof-of-concept to strip the mod out of this functionality.

Very smol but very useful mod; you'll likey likey :)
